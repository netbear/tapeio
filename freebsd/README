I am no longer a committer with FreeBSD, however, I will continue to
add bug fixes here. I may or may not actually synchronize with changes

a diff for CURRENT as of this date: Sun May 31 20:42:57 PDT 2009

Most of it would also apply to RELENG_7. This adds 8Gb support amongst
other (mostly target) fixes.
